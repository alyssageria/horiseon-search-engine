# horiseon-search-engine

## Description

The motivation behind this project was to refactor existing code and recognize non-semantic code than can be replaced with more semantic values. This project was built in order to create a more accessible website. With the website being more accessible it allows thoughs who may have disablities to access the page. In this project I learned the importance of keeping code clean, and leaving the code cleaner than how you found it.
